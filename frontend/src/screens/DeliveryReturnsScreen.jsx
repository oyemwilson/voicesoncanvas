        <p className="mb-4">
          All items sold on Voices on Canvas are shipped directly by the artist or art gallery. We only use authorized courier services such as FedEx, DHL, UPS, EMS, Parcelforce or any other national postal service that provides shipment tracking and proof of delivery. Once your order is shipped, a tracking number will be provided, and your order status will be updated on the Voices on Canvas platform. You can easily track your shipment using the tracking number provided. Delivery times may vary depending on your location and the shipping method selected. We do our best to ensure prompt delivery, and we will keep you informed every step of the way.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">International Shipping</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Once your payment is received and the artwork is shipped, we will provide you with a tracking number. You can track your shipment by logging in to your Voices on Canvas account and checking the order status page. Please note that delivery times vary based on the artwork’s origin, size, and weight. Additionally, any purchases for delivery outside the Artist or Art Gallery’s home country may be subject to import / export taxes, custom duties, and other international taxes. These charges vary and are subject to the laws of the destination country. Please note that this amount is not included in your final checkout price as we are unable to advise on the custom fees or taxes due by the buyer’s home country (destination). The buyer is responsible for payment of these charges.

        <p className="mb-4">
          Should you need to return the purchased artwork, buyers must ensure that all return items are carefully and correctly packaged and shipped in an unopened and new condition (same condition as received). Returns must be organized with the artist or the art gallery directly. Buyers must ensure all communications with the artist is carried out via the Voices on Canvas messaging centre, this can be found within my orders page. This allows our support team to assist with arbitration. We will not be able to open a case if direct contact or negotiations have been held or are in progress with the seller outside of the Voices on Canvas platform.

        <p className="mb-4">

A tracking number should be provided to the artist or art gallery and Voices on Canvas support team. Buyers are responsible for any shipping costs incurred during the return process, including any applicable customs duties, taxes or other charges.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          When shipping back the artwork, buyers should take photos of the item and packaging before handing over to the courier. This will help to provide evidence of the condition of the artwork and the packaging in the event of any damage that may occur during the return shipping process.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Once the artist or art gallery receives the returned artwork and confirms that it is in the same condition as when it was sold, the payment will be refunded to the buyer’s account within 5-7 business days.

        <p className="mb-4">
